# Hey, I'm Alex 👋

Software engineer and tech enthusiast based in France.
I write Go and Rust, and I'll debug anything — from code to kettles.

Currently building [Launchr](https://github.com/launchrctl) — an extensible
CLI framework in Go with a plugin architecture.
When not coding, probably overengineering my home lab.
